To start the simulation run the App/Main.java class running the Main class, some test cases are already available,using number 1-5  you can see in the console output where they move.
✨
```sh
1- Simulate 2 rovers moving, no errors
2- contains invalid commands
3- cointains invalid commands that send the rover out of the plateau
4- shows the behaviour of the rover when it meets an obstacle on its way
5- shows the behaviour of the program when the starting point is not valid
6- you can use your *custom file*!  digit or copy and paste the fileName.txt having the following format:
```
✨
```sh
1st line 2 integer numbers separated by a space - they set the max coordinates of the plateau, the grid where rovers are allowed to move
2nd line the coordinates of a rover: 2 integer numbers smaller or equals than plateau max values
3d line a sequence of character RLM R stands for RIGHT and dictate the rover to rotate right. L does the same but LEFT. M dictate the rover to move 1 grid space.
```
it's possible to move several rovers in sequence, you can add them repeating 2nd and 3rd lines format for each rover.
save your file in the main directory and choose option 6 when running App/Main.java
